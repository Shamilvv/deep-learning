# deep-learning indroduction
deep learning is defines about to working on complex nural network this topic is subset of the machine learning
type layers  in deep learning
1.input layer
receives the raw data into yhe machine

2.hidden layer
perform computations in the hidden layer which is proccessing the data 

3.output layer
provides the final output and prediction on classification

Activate function in deep learning:

RELU : rectifiedd linear unit:
which is used to the hidden layer to show the data in the gradients of the data and which is simply used to speed up durimg the training of the data.
2.sigoid:
  map the values binary(0and1 in the layer).
3.software
cover the raw data (source) convert into the probability on the given data.
